/**
 * A manifold point is a contact point belonging to a contact manifold. It holds
 * details related to the geometry and dynamics of the contact points. The local
 * point usage depends on the manifold type:
 * <ul>
 * <li>circles: the local center of circleB</li>
 * <li>faceA: the local center of circleB or the clip point of polygonB</li>
 * <li>faceB: the clip point of polygonA</li>
 * </ul>
 * This structure is stored across time steps, so we keep it small.<br/>
 * Note: the impulses are used for internal caching and may not provide reliable
 * contact forces, especially for high speed collisions.
